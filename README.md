CTC23 project to help free cities from noise pollution

The concept is showing noise levels on map and a breakdown of what the sources are.

The second phase is to allow stakeholders to join the location and say how they are affected.

The third phase is to all the suggestion and implementation of solutions to reduce the noise (such as living walls, trees, installations etc.)
